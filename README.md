# UFOs 
The purpose behind this project was to build an HTML page while using JavaScript. We wanted to provide a brief analysis on UFO sightings which were filtered into the following settings: 

1. City 
2. Country
3. Date
4. Shape of UFOs sightings 
5. State

Using these filters we can get a better idea of how many possible sightings are from city to city or even possibly state to state. We can use this information and set up better surveillance in order to capture better pictures of these UFOs. 

## Results:
I was able to merge a JPG image behind the title while using JavaScript. I was also able to create narrow search criteria, which would allow for easier research. We can also narrow down the searches to find the ones with the most similar reporting that were made on the same day and conduct further investigation on these claims.

If we were to inspect areas that historically have more details inputted, we may be able to snap pictures of our own! It is always nice to be able to pinpoint our search criteria as it helps us establish a better baseline. 

## Summary
### Drawbacks: 
I believe that there should be an "enter" button placed there as I was guessing on whether or not to press the "enter" button to narrow down the search. We could also maybe input a guideline for the date entry such as "mm/dd/yyyy" as this may remove confusion when searching. 

### Additional Recommendations: 
I would recommend using the data and creating another search criteria which captures the dates that have more than 5+ sightings. This would be useful rather than searching through each day. I would also recommend that we are able to search through the comments inputted. There may be a particular sighting with a specific name associated with it and people might not remember the specific date. An example of this could be the "Rosswell Incident," which is famously known for the event but not the date.
